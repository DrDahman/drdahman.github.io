NAME
	NEAT - PmWiki 2 skin

DESCRIPTION

	The skin was inspired by Sinorca (colors) and RoundFlow (layout) and It looks good in firefox and konqueror so far.

	I'll keep updating to include new functionality and correct errors you may find.

	If you are going to use in a UNIX enviroment, be sure to pay attention to permissions and ownership, the files inside the zip file have none of those set.


INSTALLATION

	To add the theme to your PmWiki2 installation, follow these basic steps:

	1. Download the theme archive and extract the files it contains.

	2. Upload the directory 'neat' to the pub/skins directory provided by PmWiki on your server.

	3. Add the following to your local configuration file (config.php).

	    $Skin = 'neat';

	4. Look at ownership and permission of files if you have any trouble.
